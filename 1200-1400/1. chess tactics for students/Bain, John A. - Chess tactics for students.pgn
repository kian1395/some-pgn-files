{In short algebraic notation, each square on a Chess board is identified by a
letter followed by a number. The letter identifies a file  (  column  )  , and
the number identifies a rank  (  row  )  . Each. square is uniquely identified
by its file letter and row number. Look at Example 1 at the left. - The White
King is on g1; the Black King is on g8. - The White Queen is on d3; the Black
Queen is on h6. - The White Rook is on d 1; the Black Rook is on a8. - The
White pawns are on f2, g2. and h2; the Black pawns are on f7, g7, and h7. }  *

{ To identify a piece  (  except the Knight and the pawns  )  , write the first
letter of the name of the piece. Write N to identify a Knight, and do not write
any letter to identify a pawn. Capital letters identify pieces {K, Q, R, B, and
 N), while lower-case letters identify squares (b2, c5, etc. ). To record a 
move, write the letter of the piece followed by the name of the square to which
 the piece will move. Write Qd8+ to indicate a White Queen move to d8. "+" 
 indicates "Ch.eck." } 1. Qd8+ Rxd8 2. Rxd8#  *
